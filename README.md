## Ace in Another World
a.k.a. That Time You Were Reincarnated In A Fantasy World Surrounded By Beautiful Women But Weren't Interested In Any of Them!!

Inspired by all of the isekai trash anime I've watched with my boyfriend, and all the times I wanted to tell the poor girls who throw themselves at the protagonist to _get a grip_ because they deserve so much better.

This game's got it all:
* Overpowered protagonist for no reason
* Completely inconsistent characterization
* Decisions that have no impact or consequences
* Anti-climactic final battle

The story is written in second person ("you") and makes no references to the player's gender. The title is in reference to an asexual point of view, but the story makes no explicit references to the player's sexuality.
